### Resume

One of the objectives of [CENTRINNO](https://www.centrinno.eu/) is to promote educational programs and training for new professions, equipped to design, create and manage services and products that respond to the social, economic and ecological challenges of the 21st century. Both the training programs and the challenges can be connected to the local reality of the pilot project in Barcelona, in the district of Sant Martí, or replicate the results beyond.

**CHALLENGE: Promote responsible use of plastic and give visibility to Sant Martí's creative sector**

The problem of plastic is unquestionable. Every year, millions of animals die from plastics found in nature. This challenge is an opportunity to develop new products that demonstrate that another use of plastic is possible.
The aim of the challenge is to design and prototype products or objects with one or two sheets of recycled plastic of 2050 x 910 x 20 mm or 2050 x 910 x 10 mm. The products may respond to a need in your center or in your surroundings, but it will be valued if they are connected to an urban problem in Sant Martí (Barcelona), such as the visibility of the Creative District, formed by the community of Poblenou Urban District.

### Rules

- The project to be functional.
- There must be a mobile app 
- There must be an interface with Vuetify
- There must be a server layer with node
- File management must be done in the server layer 
- There must be a persistence layer managed by the server
